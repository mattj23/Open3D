/* This example code performs a stress test of the various line/ray
 * intersections with the AxisAlignedBoundingBox to highlight the different
 * performance implications of each.
 *
 * The slab method is currently industry standard for ray tracing as it is
 * incredibly fast, however it can degenerate in circumstances when the line or
 * ray being tested lies entirely within one of the planes of the bounding box.
 * In a problem which is not conditioned to have this occur it would be a
 * statistical near-impossibility, and if it did occur it typically have no
 * serious consequences.
 *
 * However, in a problem which involves rays or lines in a single direction
 * on a regularly spaced grid that coincides with bounding box limits, it is
 * feasible to have it occur. If the consequences of a missed intersection are
 * unacceptable, the naive exact solution will return the correct answer at a
 * significant cost to performance.
 *
 * However, if performance is still critical and the problem is conditioned to
 * be degenerate for the slab method, it's likely that the problem is operating
 * in some reduced dimensionality where a full 3D intersection test is
 * unnecessary and even better performance can be gained with a custom
 * implementation.
 *
 * In the following single threaded test on a Xeon E5-2670 v2 from within a VM,
 * for 1 million bounding box/ray intersections, the following performance was
 * observed:
 *
 *      674ms for the exact method
 *       36ms for the slab method
 *       29ms for the slab method with precomputed inverses
